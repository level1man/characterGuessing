# Who Am I?

A mini-game developed with React Native. I made it for my 6-year-old girl who loves everything from Disney.

The game is a simple image reveal game. The app will randomly pick an image from the database. The image was covered by a 4 X 5 grid with only one tile uncovered. The player then guesses what the character is. There is a hint button that allows the player to reveal 3 more tiles. After using 3 hints, the player cannot get any more hints and the button will be disabled. The image will never repeat within one single game, and the tile reveal is also random.

There are 10 questions per game. 10 points per question. The screen will show whether the answer is correct. It will add 10 points to the player score and it will show on the top right of the screen.

After 10 questions were being asked, it will show the game over screen with the final score and a Play again button that allows the player to play again.
